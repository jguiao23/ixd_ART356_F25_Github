#Chapter 3 Of DOET Relfection

I think this chapter really cemented to me how much one tiny bit of effort into a design descision can ultimately impact the product as a whole. 

To start this reflection, the second part of this chapter presented the overall theme of conventions and standardization and how the human mind plays a part in that. 

Norman talks about conventions being a "special kind of cultural constraint." (page 146). He talks to this about how this constraint could acts a guide but also could be a detriment if you are not familar with that kind of convention. The one that caught my eye was his discussion about the U.S measure convention of inches instead of the metric scale. This one I agree with Norman because I always questioned why haven't we swtiched? 

This made me reflect on my daily life. And it gets me frustrated when I am at the multiple gyms where one weight is measured in Pounds(LBS) vs Kilograms(KG). Even though the american system is very simple, Kilograms provide a more easier way to calculate the exact weight you are lifting.(And they also are more colorful :) )

This leads into the rest of the chapter and what always puzzles me in design. Standardization.
It is clear that most humans do not like change, espcially drastic change. But I always questioned how can we improve products if we are just liking how it is already.

Thats when Norman talked about Skeumorphic Design. I was always trying to find a term for something that takes inspiration from the past and modifies it with a new twist. 
He brings up the example of how cars have evolved from looking like horse carriages without horse to not shiny cars we see today. 

If there is something that I could always remember and take away from this chapter is that, humans find comfort in familarity so if you want to show something new present them they can look back on.
