#Chapter 2 of DOET

In this chapter I got to reflect on the psychology of what it means to having a goal and taking action on for anything I do. 

I actually found myself particularly interest in the statements Norman said about goals and subconcious mind. In page 42, Normal explains that the "root cause analysis: asking "why"? until the ultimate, fundamental cause of teh activity is reached. I thought this statement of asking why makes you realize, we assume a lot of our goals/intentions because it is second nature to us, like eating.

The other big piece that I found useful was learning to understand the stages of how people take action. Learning the 7 steps and separating the two gaps of Guilf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation. It made relfection on what actions I take on the products I use. 

The example I thought is the bluetooth connection I have for my car.
1. My goal was to listen to music in the car
2. I will use my bluetooth and connect it to spotify 
3. I plug or wait for my bluetooth connector in my car to connect to my phone.
4. I pick a song on phone and drive
5. I hear the car speaker saying "waiting for pairing.... Paired" then then the music playing in my car
6. I know the music is playing in my car
7. I was able to listen to music in the car.

It really visualized what Norman was saying about feedback playing a big role in the gulf of evaluation because if I didn't hear that the bluetooth was still pairing, I would think my phone or the internet was the problem of not hearing my music.
