# Chapter 1 Eloquent Javascript Values, Types & Operators

This chapter is a beginning baseline of the the following: 

- Here we dived into the very root of what happens in a computer which is BITS(0&1)
  What I found interesting is that bits is that the chunks of bits are only divisable by 8. I am wondering what is the importance.


- The types of values(numbers strings,booleans & Empty.

- The types of Operators(Unary, Binary, Logical & Ternary)

- The importance of Automatic Type Converstion & affecting the value definition

Overall learning about the values and operators is easy to remember just because it is similar to p5.jss

Here are things that I found confusing and interesting going forward:

-Learning about the condition operator(ternary operator " ? 1:2 " ) I am wondering where would I find the 3 third value to determine T or F.
Also when would I used this operator instead of an if statement 

- trying to remeber all the types of oprerators.
