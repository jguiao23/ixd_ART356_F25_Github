Based on What I read for chapter 5 Part 2. This Chapter is all about identifying errorrs and what to do when you encounter different types of errors.

I think the one that intriged me the most was the topic of reporting errors. In this portion they talk about how its common for people to ignore or dont admit with they are wrong because of them feeling pressured or scared of being punished.

I can definitely relate to that both in my work and my personal life. At my job I get scared that I made my error because I feel like it would give me a write up when instead i should be comfortable because it is a safety issue.
I like the example that Norman gives on the Nasa Aviation Safety Reporting System. On page 193-194 he describes how NASA provided a self anonymous reporting system where when a pilot has seen or made an error, they can reported, explain the situation, then their information would get removed, protecting them from commercial or FAA.

This made me wonder, if people are being questioned that work about a sitation, how likely is it that they are telling the whole truth if they are going to be penalized for it.
How can we ensure that people feel comfortable telling the truth without being judged? Thats why I like NASA tactic because it shows that they have empathy for the pilots aka the people who are able to identify and explain a error.
