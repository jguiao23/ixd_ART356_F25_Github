#Chapter 2 Eloquent Javascript Program Structure

The first day of reading I learn more techincal terms of prgramming to the vanilla js instead of p5.js

It started out with the basics such as an "Expression". which is just a code that produces a value.

We then learned about Bindings: Which lets javascript hold,catch and define values and allows them to do certain functions with those values.

What was interesting is seeing a sneak peak of the different rescricted binding names not discovered yet in p5(yield,debugger) but also symbols like ($ and _) which got me interest to know what those symbols are for.


What is good about p5.js is that the functions in p5 are work the same as vanilla (If, else,for). 
So it was nice hearing that code still runs in a story top to bottom.
